# Statistical Processing Control Demo - Fridge Temperature Evaluation

# Program Description:
# This program reads FridgeTemp.csv data from a remote URL and plots a statistical 
# processing control chart of the temperature in Celsius. The control chart shows 
# the mean, upper control limit, and lower control limit for the data, which are 
# calculated using the mean and standard deviation. The purpose of this program is 
# to demonstrate how to create a control chart using matplotlib in Python.

# Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
